Added by Michael Floerchinger for Assignment 2

Modification of the SuDoKu application supplied for Assignment 2.

Replace all the usage of the Vector Class instances with the equivalent Java Collections Framework ArrayList
Changes applied in:
-StateStack.java
-Composer.java

Original code remains as originally intended, however now commented out 
with // <original code snippet remaining> & "// edited by &MF" tag added to each instance of change

Javadoc: created Javadoc comments for each change applied, containing:
- details of the changed vector to collection framework
- details of the changed items, from & to
- details of the function of what the code does
- detail of of javadoc annotations @params
NOTE: many comments within the code were not totally relevant within the Javadocs, so many
times explanations of method() changes were included in the @param section, when that is not
the appropiate location

Addition of the readme.txt file in sourcecode.
